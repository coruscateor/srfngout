# srfngout

Semi-Random Filename Generator Out

This tool outputs strings that can be used to name files.

Example usage:

```
.\srfngout
13072022_5m88i663tw17265F
```

Commandline arguments may be supported in the future.

## Coding Style

This project uses a coding style the emphasises the use of white space over keeping the line and column counts as low as possible.

So this:

```rust
fn foo()
{

    bar();

}

```

Not this:

```rust
fn foo()
{
    bar();
}

```
